## Introduction

The Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, scheduled to take place from August 28 to September 8, 2024, will mark a significant milestone in the history of the Paralympic movement. As the first Paralympic Games to be held in Paris, this event is expected to showcase the extraordinary talents of over 4,000 athletes from around the globe, competing in 549 medal events across 22 sports. This essay explores the significance of the 2024 Paralympics, the sports involved, the athletes to watch, the event's historical context, and its impact on society.

## Historical Context of the Paralympic Games

The Paralympic Games have evolved significantly since their inception. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960, featuring 400 athletes from 23 countries. This event was rooted in the Stoke Mandeville Games, organized by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann in 1948 to aid the rehabilitation of World War II veterans. The term "Paralympic" derives from the Greek word "para," meaning "beside" or "alongside," indicating that the Paralympics exist alongside the Olympic Games, not in competition with them[4][7].

Over the decades, the Paralympics have grown in scale and visibility, becoming one of the largest international sporting events. The agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the Paralympic Games in the same cities and venues as the Olympics has significantly enhanced the profile of the Paralympics[5][7]. This integration has fostered greater public awareness and appreciation for athletes with disabilities.
